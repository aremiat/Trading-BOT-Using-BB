# Trading-BOT-Using-BB

This bot trade Eurusd using a simple condition.

If the price goes above the Bollinger band then the bot short.

If the price goes below the Bollinger band then the bot closes his position if he had a short postion and open a long one.

The BB is set up at 2 standard deviation. Seems like the best set up. You could use 3 sd to be more conservative but you would do way less trade in a year since the probability of the price moving out of the BB set up at 3 is really low.
